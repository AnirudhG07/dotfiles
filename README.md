Stow branch contains all the files which can be stowed. The master branch may contain them as well as other configs or my .config files. Althought the `stow` branch is the MOST IMPORTANT ONE.
## Neovim

Neovim contents are stored in a seperate branch on the repo called `nvim`. Simply download the branch and do

```bash
stow nvim
```

And you get neovim setup on Linux or MacOS.

## Taskrc setup

Taskwarrior Setup on terminal from your taskrc by-

```bash
