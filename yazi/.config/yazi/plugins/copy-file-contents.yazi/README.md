require("copy-file-contents"):setup({
	clipboard_cmd = "default",
	append_char = "\n",
	notification = true,
})
```

## Options

1. `clipboard_cmd`: Set the clipboard command to use. Use `"default"` to use the default command based on the OS.

```lua
OS_clipboard_mapping = {
	["linux"] = "xclip -selection clipboard",
	["macos"] = "pbcopy",
	["windows"] = "clip",
	["ios"] = "pbcopy",
	["freebsd"] = "xclip -selection clipboard",
	["dragonfly"] = "xclip -selection clipboard",
	["netbsd"] = "xclip -selection clipboard",
	["openbsd"] = "xclip -selection clipboard",
	["solaris"] = "xclip -selection clipboard",
	["android"] = "termux-clipboard-set",
}
```

You can set the `clipboard_cmd` to any of the above commands. The command run to copy the contents will be run as -

```bash
echo file_name | clipboard_cmd
```

2. `append_char`: Set the character to append at the end of each copied file content. Default is `"\n"`.
3. `notification`: Set to `true/false` to enable/disable notification after copying the contents. Default is `true`.
